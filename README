A simple maven project for android development 
----------------------------------------------

This project includes a HelloWorld activity as well as a sample Robolectric test case.

The project apk can be build with the usual: mvn clean install

If you want to deploy the project use: mvn android:deploy

To build and deploy use: mvn clean install android:deploy

You must start the emulator before deployment with: mvn android-emulator-start

You need to setup the jdk6.home and jdk6.compiler properties either in your pom.xml or in your ~/.m2/settings.xml. This points to the correct jdk to use.

The default name of the emulator is: AVD-2.3.3-10. You must change this to match the emulator instance you want to start and/or deploy to.
